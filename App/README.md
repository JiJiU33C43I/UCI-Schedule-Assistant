# How to Run the Source Code on Your PC/Laptop?
This project uses several external libraries for development. Usual way to run the source code is to download/install python and also all the libraries required. You might see what kinds of library are required on our [General Wiki page](https://github.com/JiJiU33C43I/UCI-Schedule-Assistant/wiki/UCI-Schedule-Assistant-Wiki). 

If your operating system is windows os, then we provide another way for you to run our source code. That is, you could also run the batch file we provide and the source code should run successfully without any external command/operation. This will generally NOT work on other os besides the Windows os.


### General Requirements to Run the Batch File (Windows OS only)
* Your os must be one of the current windows os.
* You must have python installed on your machine
* You must have pip installed on your machine

### Steps to Run the Batch File
1. You must fulfil all requirements above in order to successfully run the batch file
2. Run "create_venv.bat"
3. Run "run.bat"
